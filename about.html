                <p>Technology has been my passion for as long as I can remember. Since childhood, I‚Äôve been fascinated by the mechanics of how things work - electricity, motors, systems - constantly asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow.‚Äù While most people simply use the tools around them, I‚Äôve always felt driven to dig deeper, to uncover the hidden workings beneath the surface. To me, technology is like an ever-expanding universe waiting to be explored. Every discovery brings a sense of accomplishment, and I‚Äôm on a mission to not only understand these systems but to build them myself.</p>
                
                <h3>My Projects</h3>
                <p>Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve always had big ideas - like creating a global mesh device network where every device communicates with nearby ones to securely transfer data across the world. I wish I had learned programming earlier, but now that I have the tools, I‚Äôm bringing my ideas to life.</p>
                
                <p>Some of the projects I‚Äôm working on include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Music Metadata System</strong>: A massive database that collects metadata for tracks, albums, and artists, making it accessible via APIs.</li>
                  <li><strong>Python-Based Static Website Hosting</strong>: A service that hosts static websites with free HTTPS certificates and provides a web-based UI for easy access and management.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Outside of Tech</h3>
                <p>Technology isn‚Äôt just a career for me‚Äîit‚Äôs my passion. I spend most of my free time experimenting, coding, building projects, and designing user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing. I‚Äôm also drawn to anything creative‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs UI design, photography, or exploring new forms of expression. While I don‚Äôt have my own camera, I love borrowing my cousin‚Äôs now and then to capture moments and tell stories through photos.</p>  
                <p>When I‚Äôm not knee-deep in code or lost in a creative project, I enjoy being outdoors, traveling to new places, and meeting new people. I thrive on new experiences, love socializing, and find joy in learning about others‚Äô stories and perspectives.</p>
                
                <h3>My Goals</h3>
                <p>I aim to build tech that truly matters - tools and systems that improve people‚Äôs lives and make technology more accessible to everyone. Innovation should benefit everyone, and I want to be a part of making that happen.</p>
                
                <h3>What I‚Äôm Learning</h3>
                <p>Currently, I‚Äôm studying <strong>Java</strong> at university - a powerful language that‚Äôs both complex and highly efficient. In my spare time, I‚Äôm diving into <strong>web development</strong>, focusing on building web apps that feel as smooth and seamless as native applications across devices like iPhones, Androids, and Windows PCs. In fact, this very website is something I built myself.</p>
