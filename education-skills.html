                <h2>My Current Education at Edge Hill University</h2>
                <p>
                  I am currently a first-year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at 
                  <em>Edge Hill University</em> in Ormskirk, England. My course provides a solid foundation in key areas of computing, and I am excited to build my skills throughout this three-year program.
                </p>
                <h3>Modules & Coursework</h3>
                <p>
                  In my first semester I successfully completed modules including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Differential Calculus</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Programming 1</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Foundations of Computer Science</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Currently, in my second semester, I am deepening my expertise through modules such as 
                  <strong>Professional Practice</strong>, <strong>Computer and Network Architecture</strong>, and <strong>Programming 2</strong>. Although I had previous experience with Python, the university coursework has refined my knowledge and led me to explore additional technologies - most recently, I have started learning <strong>Java</strong>. I look forward to continuously expanding my programming repertoire as I progress through my degree.
                </p>

                <h2>King George V Sixth Form College</h2>
                <p>
                  At King George V Sixth Form College, I studied a wide curriculum that included First Year Maths, A-Level Computer Science, A-Level Psychology, BTEC Applied Science, and an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ).
                </p>
                
                <h3>A-Level Computer Science NEA Project</h3>
                <p>
                  For my A-Level Computer Science NEA (Non-Examined Assignment), I developed a <strong>School Register System</strong> using <em>Visual Basic</em>. This system allowed teachers to enroll students, save data in an SQL database, and track attendance efficiently. The project was designed with the needs of a lower income country in mind, and my client for this assignment was my cousin in Bangladesh - a teacher seeking a practical school management solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This hands-on project enabled me to enhance my skills in Visual Basic, object-oriented programming (via the use of classes), functional programming, agile methodologies, and the MoSCoW method. If youre intrested in my NEA project, have a look at the report:

                <h3>Extended Project Qualification (EPQ): Research on AI in Education</h3>
                <p>
                  I also completed an EPQ - equivalent to half an A-Level - focusing on the <strong>societal impacts of Artificial Intelligence</strong> in education, with a special focus on generative AI. My research examined how AI can boost productivity for both students and teachers, while also addressing potential challenges such as over-reliance on technology and the loss of essential independent skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project involved surveying peers, conducting in-depth research, and critically analysing the data, which in turn refined my skills in research, referencing, critical analysis, and presentation. For further insights and a detailed report on this EPQ project, please check out:
